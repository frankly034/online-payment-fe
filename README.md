<!-- concepts and apis employed -->

## Concepts and APIs Employed

- The API employed for donation was gotten from a previous project: [Online Payment API](https://github.com/frankly034/online-payment-api). Checkout the youtube playlist of a walkthrough on how the API was built [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLseH49SWn6vbVS_QQLkWdRrZFeLauLpzH).
- API documentation can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17383417/2s93RXtqr5)
- This app demonstrates the use of React concepts like:
  - Compnents structuring
  - Routing and templating with [react route dom v6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
  - API integration with [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
  - Data fetching management with [@tanstack/react-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query)
  - Custom hooks
  - Typescript concepts like (generics, interfaces, etc)
  - Form validation with [formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik) and [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup)
  - Simple form generator with validation using formik and yup
